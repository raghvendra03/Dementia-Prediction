# Dementia-Prediction
Analyzed and tried to understand if someone is likely to get Alzheimer’s 

## Introduction
### What is Dementia

Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. Dementia is not a specific disease. It’s an overall term that describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.

There is no one proper test which can tell you weather the patient has got dementia or it's very unpredictable as the Doctors do some carefull observations and checkups.

## Overview of Data

The main factor we determine here is CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) which will help us in understanding the performance related to the dementia disease. Their rating is given as 
(0 = Normal, 0.5 = Very Mild Dementia, 1 = Mild Dementia, 2 = Moderate Dementia, 3 = Severe Dementia)

The other factore which affects this is: 
1. M.F - Gender
2. Age
3. EDUC - Years of education
4. SES - Socioeconomic status 
5. MMSE - Mini-Mental State Examination score (range is from 0 = worst to 30 = best)
6. eTIV - Estimated total intracranial volume, mm3
7. nWBV - Normalized whole-brain volume
8. ASF - Atlas scaling factor
